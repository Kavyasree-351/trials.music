# 🎶 Carnatic Raga Generator & Sarali Player
**Author:** Kavya  

This project is an **interactive Carnatic music tool** built in Python (Google Colab compatible). It generates **random swara patterns** in the **Mayamalavagowla raga**, visualizes them with **Adi Tala (8-beat cycle)**, and allows playback via **audio synthesis and MIDI files**.  

It is a fun blend of **music theory, programming, and visualization**, ideal for learners and enthusiasts of Carnatic music.
