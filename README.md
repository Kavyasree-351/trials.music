 Carnatic Raga Tala Visualizer with Audio – Mayamalavagowla Edition This is a basic interactive project I tried out in Google Colab to explore how technology and Carnatic music can come together. It generates random swara patterns (notes) in the Mayamalavagowla raga, and visualizes them in sync with the Adi Tala (8-beat cycle).
